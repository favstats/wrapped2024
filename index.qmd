## 🗓️1️⃣ January

*Microtargeting in Taiwan 🇹🇼*

<br>

In January, [Justin Ho](https://bsky.app/profile/justinho.bsky.social) and I launched a dashboard with [Who Targets Me](whotargets.me) on how Taiwanese political parties are using **Facebook and Instagram ads** to target voters during the presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan. 🗳️✨

<br>

## 🗓️2️⃣ February

*Presenting at the NORFACE Conference in Vienna 🇦🇹*

<br>

I attended the **NORFACE Governance Final Conference** at the University of Vienna. The conference brought together international scholars to discuss themes in **democratic governance**, such as polarization, disinformation, and citizen trust in institutions.

<br>

I was happy to present our manuscript, **_"Accepting Exclusion"_** (more on that later), alongside my great friend and colleague [Sophie Minihold](https://bsky.app/profile/sophism.bsky.social). 

<br>

Beyond the academic discussions, it was a great time connecting with colleagues and friends and soaking in the historic beauty of the University of Vienna. ✨

## 🗓️3️⃣ March

*Who Doesn('t) Target You?  🌍*

<br>

In March, the **third paper** of my dissertation was accepted at the **[Journal of Quantitative Description](https://journalqd.org/article/view/4188)**. This paper dives into **(micro)targeting strategies** used across *113 elections worldwide*, shedding light on how political parties allocate their budgets for targeting and exclusion criteria.  ✨

<br>

I was in Amsterdam when I got the news, which made it all the more special: since I might have felt like dancing a little. 💃

<br>

## 🗓️4️⃣ April

*The Room Where It Happened 🎓✨*

<br>

On April 19th, **I successfully defended my PhD**, marking the culmination of years of research, challenges, and growth. It’s hard to put into words the gratitude I feel for everyone who supported me along this journey. From colleagues to mentors, friends, and family, my paranymphs, and my partner, you’ve all shaped who I am today. 💙

<br>

The defense was both humbling and exhilarating. Thank you for all who were there on this day!

## 🗓️5️⃣ May

*AlgoSoc AI Opinion Monitor 🤖📊*

<br>

In May, [Ernesto de Leon](https://bsky.app/profile/ernesto-deleon.com) and I  officially launched the **[AlgoSoc AI Opinion Monitor](https://monitor.algosoc.org/en/)**, a dashboard providing insights into public opinion on **AI technologies** in the Netherlands. 

<br>

Together with the **[AlgoSoc consortium](https://algosoc.org)** and **[Centerdata](https://www.centerdata.nl)**, we surveyed over **4,000 respondents** to uncover how people use and trust AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **MidJourney**. Excited to see how this project evolves—stay tuned for updates! 🌟

*ICA 2024 in Gold Coast, Australia 🌏✨*

<br>

In June, I attended the **[ICA 2024 Conference](https://www.icahdq.org/)** in Gold Coast, Australia: my first time visiting the land down under! 

<br>

The conference, themed **"Communication and Global Human Rights"**, was inspiring and packed with engaging presentations and discussions.

<br>

But the highlights didn’t stop there: I also had the chance to see **wild kangaroos** and **whales** for the first time together with [Jin Wan](https://bsky.app/profile/wanjin.bsky.social), [Johannes Gruber](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ntd53albt5ffa4rgervvgibd), and [Ernesto de Leon](https://bsky.app/profile/ernesto-deleon.com)! 🐋🦘

## 🗓️7️⃣ July

*Visiting Taiwan 🐾🇹🇼*

<br>

In July, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Taiwan, connecting with fellow academics and discussing my research on **microtargeting** during the **2024 Taiwanese elections**.   

<br>

My personal (unexpected) highlight of the year: while exploring the countryside of northern Taiwan, I stumbled upon a **giant dog statue** at a temple. 🐕 This surprise discovery was a delightful moment of awe and wonder. 

<br>

For more information about this temple, known as the **Temple of the Eighteen Lords**, you can look here: [Temple of the Eighteen Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_the_Eighteen_Lords).

*Summer Vibes in Berlin ☀️🏖️*

<br>

August was all about soaking up the summer in **Berlin**. One of the highlights was seeing **Alligatoah** perform live which was a fantastic experience. 🎶✨

## 🗓️9️⃣ September

*Large Language Models 📚🤖*

<br>

In September, **[Johannes Gruber](https://johannesbgruber.eu)** and I were thrilled to have our chapter on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** accepted for the **Encyclopedia of Political Communication (2025)**! 🎉  

<br>

Our chapter explores the transformative impact of LLMs like **ChatGPT** on political communication research, highlighting both their immense potential and the challenges they pose in regards to bias, validity, and reproducibility. ✨  

<br>

## 🗓️🔟 October

*"Accepting Exclusion" Published 📚✨*

<br>

October also brought great news: **[Sophie Minihold](https://bsky.app/profile/sophism.bsky.social)** and I published our article, **"Accepting Exclusion: Examining the (Un)Intended Consequences of Data-Driven Campaigns,"** in **[Media and Communication](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/8685)**! 🎉 

<br>

The study investigates the (un)intended consequences of **data-driven campaigns** during the Dutch elections of 2021 and 2023. In this study we shed light on **who gets excluded** but also **how citizens perceive these exclusions**.  

<br>

You can read the full article here: **[Accepting Exclusion](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/8685)** 🔗.

## 🗓️1️⃣1️⃣ November

*"The Cost of Reach" Accepted 🎉📘*

<br>

In November, my *final dissertation paper*, **"The Cost of Reach: Testing the Role of Ad Delivery Algorithms in Online Political Campaigns,"** was officially accepted for publication in **Political Communication**! 🎊  

<br>

This study, conducted with [Tom Dobber](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/o/t.dobber/t.dobber.html), [Benjamin Guinadeau](https://www.benjamin-guinadeau.com), [Natali Helberger](https://www.ivir.nl/team/helberger/), and [Claes de Vreese](https://bsky.app/profile/claesdevreese.bsky.social), explores the critical role of **ad delivery algorithms** in digital political advertising. 

<br>

By collaborating with Dutch political parties, we uncover how these algorithms influence the cost of reaching different audiences and find some evidence of **price discrimination** where the same service did not lead to the same price.

<br>
